# Eventnotify
Many undergraduate students today are unaware of technical activities like conferences, meetups, workshops and hackathons because of lack of a medium to promote or advertise such events.

This will be a platform built on python-django for bringing together all students where they can create and post single line feeds indicating any of these:
<ul>
<li>1. I know about this event at this place on this topic. Care to attend?</li>
<li>2. I wish to go to this place for this event. Would you like to join?</li>
<li>3. I am organizing this event, how about accompanying me?</li>
</ul>

All the feeds will have links to the respective web pages of the corresponding events.
Locations and event topics will be mentioned as hashtags to make it easier to apply filters while searching.
